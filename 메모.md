## 가상환경 설치

### 1) conda 이용(anaconda 성공!!! -> miniconda 실패!!!)

```
D:\__sunchan\project\bbs> conda create --name dj python=3.7.1

D:\__sunchan\project\bbs>activate dj
```

```
Solving environment: failed

CondaHTTPError: HTTP 000 CONNECTION FAILED for url <https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/win-64/repodata.json.bz2>
Elapsed: -

An HTTP error occurred when trying to retrieve this URL.
HTTP errors are often intermittent, and a simple retry will get you on your way.

If your current network has https://www.anaconda.com blocked, please file
a support request with your network engineering team.

```

### 2) python -m venv 이용
```
python -m venv dj

python -m venv [가상환경이름]
```


```
dj\Scripts\activate.bat

### pip 업그레이드
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

(dj) D:\__sunchan\project\bbs>python -m pip install --upgrade pip

[[꿀팁 031] - pip가 sslError로 인해 실행되지 않는 경우, ssl 모듈이 없는 경우|작성자 GIS 프로그래머](http://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=dkzksp0812&logNo=221257119485&categoryNo=0&parentCategoryNo=0&viewDate=&currentPage=1&postListTopCurrentPage=1&from=postView)

나중에 안 사실이지만 openssl 설치를 먼저 해주지 않고 python 설치 후 pip를 시도하면 생기는 에러였다.

그래도 나중에 혹시 모르니 참고로 끄적여 본다.

아나콘다로 설치된 파이썬 버전을 확인해보자.

현재 설치된 버전은 Python 3.6.5 아나콘다 버전이다.

Python pip 업그레이드

Python -m pip install --upgrade pip

위 명령 실행.



SSLError. 처음부터 오류 발생. 느낌이 좋지 않다. Stupid!

Distributed 1.21.8 requires msgpack. Which is not installed.



SSL 문제로 upgrade 불가하여 

conda의 ssl 인증 설정을 해제하고 , conda 명령어로 업그레이드


```
conda config --set ssl_verify false

conda upgrade pip
```


pip upgrade 완료. Very nice!
